"http://focu.io/data#COMM499","SEMINAR COURSE","COMM","499",,"3.0","This is not a case competition course. Instead, under the auspices of l'Association des Agences de Communication CrÃÂ©ative (A2C), every year two Quebec inter-university competitions are organized and conducted. The RelÃÂ¨ve Communication was initiated in 1992 and the RelÃÂ¨ve Marketing in 1999. JMSB has entered teams of six students in both of these competitions since their inception. For both, participating university teams are given a day-long briefing in January by a company, not-for-profit organization or government agency and one or more of its communications agencies. The brief concludes with a mandate for which teams must create a complete communications or marketing plan for the client with a due date in late April. Their recommended plans are presented to the clients in their boardrooms or in their agency's pitch rooms. The judging panels include senior executives from the client (often its CEO), from the client's communications agencies and from A2C members. Throughout the academic term during which the competitions occur, students have the opportunity to apply the theories that they have learned so far in their BComm program to situations which are as close to 'real life' as possible in an academic setting."
